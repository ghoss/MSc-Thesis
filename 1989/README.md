##Thesis Source Code##
This directory contains the C source code of the calculation programs my thesis is based on.

The sources in subdirectory "1989" are the original versions. They compiled on **SunOS** and **Microsoft Xenix** back then.
Eventually, I hope to find the time to port them to a current environment.

I'm making this code available under the **GPLv3 license** for the enjoyment and education of the generations after me.
